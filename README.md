# Git-Demo
this is my first git demo

In Git there are Four types of status 
<h4>Untracked- when a new file is craeted which was not in the git repo.</h4>
 <h4>Modified- when we can changes inside the files like texts.</h4>
<h4>staged- when the file is ready to be commited example when the file are added to git after somechanges or new file is added then they aready to be commited.</h4>
<h4>unmodified- when it is untouched or no changes are made to it.</h4>
