# Git-Demo

<h2>This is my first git demo</h2>

In Git there are Four types of status

<h4>Untracked- when a new file is craeted which was not in the git repo.</h4>
 <h4>Modified- when we can changes inside the files like texts.</h4>
<h4>staged- when the file is ready to be commited example when the file are added to git after somechanges or new file is added then they aready to be commited.</h4>
<h4>unmodified- when it is untouched or no changes are made to it.</h4>

<h2> git push -u origin main </h2>
 -> Here u is used set upstream meaning if we are going to push into the same repository then we can set the origin so next time we push we can directly use <b>git push</b>

<h2> Branches in git </h2>
 -> branches are the names of the projects, there can be multiple branches where each branch is for different use, so that everyone is working without wait for other branch to complete.
 now when every branch completes their work then they can merge it.

<h2> To change the name of the branch  </h2>
 <h4>-> git branch -m name of the branch</h4>

<h2> To navigate to different Branches  </h2>
<h4>-> git checkout branch name </h4>

<h2> To create a new branch </h2>
<h4>-> git checkout -b new branch name </h4>

 <h2>To delete a Branch </h2>
 <h4>-> git branch -d branch name </h4>
