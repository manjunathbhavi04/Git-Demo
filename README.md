# Git-Demo
<h2>This is my first git demo</h2>

In Git there are Four types of status 
<h4>Untracked- when a new file is craeted which was not in the git repo.</h4>
 <h4>Modified- when we can changes inside the files like texts.</h4>
<h4>staged- when the file is ready to be commited example when the file are added to git after somechanges or new file is added then they aready to be commited.</h4>
<h4>unmodified- when it is untouched or no changes are made to it.</h4>

<h2> git push -u origin main </h2>
 -> Here u is used set upstream meaning if we are going to push into the same repository then we can set the origin so next time we push we can directly use <h5> git push </h5>
